# seth_website
This if my final project for CITPT-111.
I want to tranform Dr. Long's website from a type simple and standard CS professional's website to a (hopefully) similar website that isn't afraid of CSS.
### Hosting
This will be hosted with updates at https://isoptera.lcsc.edu/~cshumaker/seth_website
## Uniquities
I want to use this as an opportunity to impliment some of my basic JS skills, mostly in the page for CS-101.
